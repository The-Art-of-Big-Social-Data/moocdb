## Motivation
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are becoming an increasingly popular at-a-distance learning option for many students. They're free and available to everyone, and they're huge. Most support a discussion forum where students can reason about course content. These courses also typically feature lectures, readings, assignments, and quizzes / exams. All of this offers a ton of data about the students in the course, something that can be difficult for instructors to get a grasp of. But this also offers a great opportunity for researchers instrested in mining through this data to find connections between participation and learning, dropout rates, subgroup formation, and just about anything else. 

## Goal
How we organize all this data is critically important. This work aims to construct a general, useful, and extensible framework for managing and analyzing all of the data that we might get from a MOOC (and other online communities).
